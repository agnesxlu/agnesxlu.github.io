            <p>I'm a bilingual multimedia journalist from Wuhan, China. I used to work as a campus fact-checker and data journalist in NJU Factcheck, a student newsroom in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing_University">Nanjing University</a> After graduating with a BA in English in 2020, I worked as a multimedia reporter in Beijing covering <a href="https://pandaily.com/author/lu-xueer/">business and technology stories</a> in China. As I return to campus for my master's degree in <a href="https://journalism.berkeley.edu/person/xueer-lu/">UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism</a>, I will be focusing on data journalism. I'm interested in stories about public policies, human rights, social justice, and the Asian community.</p>
